A code that finds an optimal solution of Traveling Salesman Problem

Approach used : Nearest Neighbour Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm

Description of approach used (max 200 words):

Firstly, The Nearest Neighbour Algorithm  is applied to the problem. 
The solution was further used as an intial solution of genetic algorithm. 
So, this solution and its fitness was sent to the mating pool and fitness_array respectively. 
Other elements of mating pool are created by mutation of nearest neighbour solution.
During selection, the solution having the biggest fitness is selected aand added to mating pool each time.
For getting better, PMX crossover was used.Mutation type is bitwise.
Then the fitness of each chromosome in mating pool is calculated and the optimal is selected.

All relevant parameters and their settings:

Population Size = 10
Maximum Iteration = 1
Tournament Size  = 2
Crossover Probability  = 0.3
Mutation Probability  = 0.5
